# Lifecycle Patterns — Sonic Pi Web

## SK1: SonicPiEngine Full Lifecycle
1. `init()` — create SuperSonic, AudioContext, AnalyserNode, VirtualTimeScheduler — ASYNC
2. `evaluate(code)` — transpile, create DSL context, execute code (registers live_loops), parse @viz comments — ASYNC
3. `play()` — scheduler.start() begins tick() timer — SYNC
4. Scheduler tick() fires every 25ms — resolves sleep Promises up to audioTime + schedAheadTime — SYNC
5. Async functions resume at await points — trigger synths via SuperSonic OSC — SYNC per resolution
6. `stop()` — scheduler.stop(), free all synth nodes — SYNC
7. `dispose()` — stop + destroy SuperSonic + clear HapStream — SYNC

## SK2: VirtualTimeScheduler Tick Cycle
1. setInterval fires (~25ms) — ASYNC (macrotask)
2. Read audioContext.currentTime — SYNC
3. Compute targetTime = audioTime + schedAheadTime — SYNC
4. While queue.peek().time <= targetTime: pop and resolve — SYNC
5. Each resolve() triggers microtask: async function resumes — MICROTASK
6. Resumed function calls play() → queues OSC message to bridge — SYNC
7. Resumed function calls sleep() → flushMessages() → new Promise pushed to queue — SYNC
8. Function suspends at next await — MICROTASK completes

**Common violation:** Resolving Promises outside tick() (breaks SV2).

## SK3: live_loop Registration and Execution
1. evaluate() executes code — SYNC within eval scope
2. `live_loop("name", {sync: "x"}, fn)` registers task with scheduler — SYNC
3. scheduler.start() begins tick timer — SYNC
4. First tick: task's virtualTime=0 is <= targetTime → resolve initial sleep(0) — SYNC
5. Auto-cue fires at start of each iteration — SYNC
6. If sync target: waitForSync parks until fresh cue fires — ASYNC
7. fn() begins executing (builds Program via ProgramBuilder) — SYNC
8. AudioInterpreter walks Program steps, queuing OSC messages — ASYNC
9. On sleep: flushMessages() dispatches ALL queued OSC as one bundle — SYNC
10. Hot-swap: replace asyncFn reference, loopSynced persists, next iteration uses new fn — SYNC

**Common violation:** Starting fn() before scheduler.start() (no tick to resolve sleeps).

## SK4: Audio Message Pipeline (Sonic Pi's 3-layer model)
1. DSL play()/sample() called at virtual time T — SYNC
2. ProgramBuilder creates Step data — SYNC
3. AudioInterpreter processes step:
   a. Compute audioTime = T + schedAheadTime — SYNC
   b. **SoundLayer:** normalizePlayParams/normalizeSampleParams/normalizeControlParams/normalizeFxParams — resolve symbols, inject defaults, alias, munge, BPM scale
   c. Queue OSC message via bridge.queueMessage(audioTime, '/s_new', args) — SYNC
4. On sleep/sync/end: bridge.flushMessages() — SYNC
   a. Encode ALL queued messages as ONE OSC bundle with single NTP timetag
   b. sonic.sendOSC(bundle) → SuperSonic
5. SuperSonic classifies bundle:
   a. nearFuture (<500ms): direct to AudioWorklet via SAB/postMessage
   b. farFuture (>500ms): Prescheduler min-heap, dispatched 500ms early
6. AudioWorklet's scsynth WASM: sample-accurate execution from NTP timetag — AUDIO THREAD
7. scsynth output → sonic-pi-mixer (Limiter.ar + LeakDC + gain) → ReplaceOut bus 0
8. Web Audio: splitter → merger → analyser → gain → speakers

**Common violation:** Sending messages immediately instead of batching (breaks SV9).
**Common violation:** Reading event log as proof of audio output (breaks SV8/Lokayata).

## SK5: FX Lifecycle (FIXED — two paths)

**Path A: Top-level FX (wrapping live_loop) — PERSISTENT**
1. SonicPiEngine.topLevelWithFx captures FX chain + assigns scope ID — SYNC
2. fxAwareWrappedLiveLoop stores scope ID in loopFxScope, chain in fxScopeChains — SYNC
3. First iteration: asyncFn checks !persistentFx.has(scopeId) — creates FX nodes ONCE
4. allocateBus + createFxGroup + applyFx for each FX in chain — ASYNC
5. Stores {buses, groups, outBus} in persistentFx keyed by scope ID
6. All subsequent iterations: task.outBus = persistentFx.get(scopeId).outBus — SYNC
7. Multiple loops under same with_fx share one scope (one set of FX nodes)
8. Cleared on stop() and re-evaluate (freeAllNodes kills group 101)

**Path B: Inner FX (b.with_fx inside loop body) — PER-ITERATION**
1. AudioInterpreter encounters 'fx' step — SYNC
2. Allocate private audio bus — SYNC
3. Create FX container group inside group 101 — SYNC
4. Create FX synth (in_bus=private, out_bus=parent) — queued message
5. Set task.outBus = private bus, run inner program — ASYNC
6. Restore outBus — SYNC
7. setTimeout(kill_delay) → freeGroup + freeBus — ASYNC

**This matches desktop:** top-level FX persists (GC blocked by subthread.join), inner FX is per-block.

## SK6: FX Lifecycle (Desktop Sonic Pi — target)
1. with_fx allocates bus, creates container group + synth group inside — SYNC
2. Creates FX synth at TAIL of container (with t_minus_delta timing) — SYNC
3. Sets thread-local out_bus and job_group to FX's bus/group — SYNC
4. Spawns GC thread — ASYNC
5. Executes block (may contain live_loop which spawns its own thread) — SYNC/ASYNC
6. Block returns, delivers subthreads to GC — SYNC
7. GC thread waits: subthread.join → tracker.block_until_finished → sleep(kill_delay) → group.kill — ASYNC
8. For live_loop wrapping: subthread.join blocks FOREVER → FX persists until Stop

## SK7: Capture Mode (Fast-Forward for queryArc)
1. Create fresh scheduler in capture mode — SYNC
2. Register loops from evaluate — SYNC
3. Run scheduler.runUntilCapture(endTime) — ASYNC
4. For each queue entry <= endTime: resolve immediately (no real-time wait) — SYNC
5. Each resolve triggers play() which captures event instead of triggering audio — SYNC
6. Continue until all tasks have virtualTime > endTime or max iterations hit — LOOP
7. Return collected events — SYNC

**Common violation:** Infinite loop if live_loop body has no sleep (SP6 error pattern).

## SK8: scsynth Node Tree (Current)
```
Root Group (0):
  Group 100 (synths, before FX)          ← ALL synths go here (even inside with_fx)
  Group 101 (FX, before mixer)           ← FX container groups + FX synth nodes
  Mixer Group (head of root)             ← sonic-pi-mixer node
```
Execution order: 100 → 101 → mixer. Correct for signal flow.

**Gap:** Inner synths should go in the FX container's synth group (like desktop), not group 100.

## SK9: scsynth Node Tree (Desktop Sonic Pi — target)
```
Root Group (0):
  STUDIO-SYNTHS (before FX)
    Run-{jobId}-Synths (per-run)
  STUDIO-FX (before mixer)
    Run-{jobId}-FX (per-run)
      FX-container (per with_fx)
        FX-synths group (head) ← inner synths HERE
        FX synth node (tail)   ← reads in_bus, writes out_bus
  STUDIO-MIXER (head of root)
    sonic-pi-mixer node
  STUDIO-MONITOR (after mixer)
    scope, amp_monitor, recorder
```
