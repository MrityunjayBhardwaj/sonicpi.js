## P0 — Ship Blockers

These must be fixed before community launch. They are correctness or safety issues.

### ~~Execution Budget (System-Wide)~~ DONE
### ~~Silent Parser Fallback~~ DONE
### ~~Per-Loop Scope Isolation~~ DONE
### ~~Verify DSL Compatibility~~ DONE (82% on real community code — motivates tree-sitter)

### Tree-sitter Ruby Transpiler (#21)
- [ ] Install web-tree-sitter + tree-sitter-ruby WASM
- [ ] Define Sonic Pi AST as TypeScript discriminated union (~40-50 node types from ~150)
- [ ] Implement transpiler as catamorphism — exhaustive switch with `never` default
- [ ] Compile-time completeness: TypeScript enforces every node type is handled
- [ ] Budget injection at AST loop nodes (replaces regex injection)
- [ ] Cover all 20 unsupported constructs from community stress tests
- [ ] Target: all 10 community programs transpile, overall ≥95%
- [ ] Preserve regex transpiler as last-resort fallback with warning
- [ ] Incremental parsing for hot-swap (<0.1ms re-parse on edit)

Architecture: the transpiler is a catamorphism (fold) over the initial algebra of the
Ruby grammar — the same mathematical structure used by our QueryInterpreter (see thesis §2.4).
Exhaustive pattern matching provides provable syntactic completeness.

## P1 — First Impressions

These affect how the app feels on first use. Fix before sharing widely.

### WASM Boot Experience
- [ ] Show loading progress during SuperSonic initialization
- [ ] Display estimated time remaining
- [ ] Pre-warm AudioContext on first user interaction

### Sample-Accurate Audio Scheduling
Currently `SuperSonicBridge.triggerSynth()` calls `sonic.send()` which fires immediately —
the `audioTime` parameter is computed but never used. Desktop Sonic Pi achieves zero-jitter
playback via timestamped OSC bundles that scsynth executes at exact sample boundaries.
SuperSonic supports this via `sonic.sendOSC(bytes)` with NTP timetags.

- [ ] Build OSC bundle encoder (binary format with NTP timetag header)
- [ ] Convert `audioTime` (AudioContext seconds) → NTP epoch time
- [ ] Replace `sonic.send()` with `sonic.sendOSC(bytes)` in `triggerSynth()`, `playSample()`, `applyFx()`
- [ ] Verify SuperSonic creates AudioContext with `latencyHint: 'interactive'`
- [ ] Expose `ctx.baseLatency + ctx.outputLatency` in console on init
- [ ] Evaluate reducing `schedAheadTime` from 100ms to 50ms
- [ ] Evaluate tightening tick interval from 25ms to 10ms
- [ ] Measure before/after jitter with spectrogram tool (target: ±0ms like desktop Sonic Pi)
- [ ] Document actual latency per platform in docs

### Tab Backgrounding
- [ ] Detect `visibilitychange` event
- [ ] Warn user when tab is backgrounded during playback
- [ ] Investigate `Web Locks API` or `Wake Lock API` for prevention

### Compile-Once Caching
- [ ] Cache compiled `new Function()` result per code string
- [ ] Reuse on hot-swap iterations instead of recompiling

## P2 — Community Credibility

These make the project look maintained and trustworthy to developers evaluating it.

### Testing & Coverage
- [ ] Add test coverage reporting (Vitest coverage + badge)
- [ ] Run tests against real Sonic Pi tutorial examples
- [ ] Add CI badge to README

### Dependency Management
- [ ] Add Renovate or Dependabot config for automated dependency updates
- [ ] Pin SuperSonic CDN version explicitly

### Documentation
- [ ] Add inline JSDoc to all public API exports
- [ ] Add architecture diagram to docs site
- [ ] Add "Known Limitations" page to docs

---

## P3 — Features

### Recording / Export
- [ ] Capture AudioContext output to WAV
- [ ] Download button in toolbar
- [ ] Duration selection (4/8/16/32 bars)

### Sample Preview
- [ ] List available samples from CDN
- [ ] Click to preview
- [ ] Search/filter

### Monorepo Split
- [ ] `@mjayb/sonicpijs` — pure engine
- [ ] `@mjayb/sonicpijs-sandbox` — sandbox + session logging
- [ ] `sonicpijs` CLI — app + editor

### Code Provenance (v2)
- [ ] Sign individual code snapshots
- [ ] Prove: student X wrote code Y at time Z
- [ ] Export signed submission for LMS integration

---

## P4 — Extensions

### MIDI I/O
- [ ] Web MIDI API output
- [ ] MIDI input as cue source
- [ ] Device selector in toolbar

### Ableton Link
- [ ] WebRTC DataChannel bridge
- [ ] Tempo/beat/phase sync
- [ ] Auto-discover on localhost

### Collaborative Editing
- [ ] CRDT sync (Yjs) for shared buffer
- [ ] WebRTC peer-to-peer
- [ ] Cursor presence
