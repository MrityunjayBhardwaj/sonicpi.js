## Make music with code. In your browser.

Sonic Pi Web is a browser-native reimplementation of [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/)'s live coding engine. Same Ruby DSL. Same synths. Same samples. No install.

I built this because Sonic Pi changed how I think about music and code, and I wanted that experience to be one click away for anyone with a browser.

All thanks to:
- **Sonic Pi** & Sam Aaron -- for proving that code is a musical instrument
- **SuperSonic** -- the WebAssembly port of SuperCollider that makes real synthesis possible in the browser
- **AudioWorklet** -- the browser API that makes low-latency audio processing work
- **Algorave community** -- for building a culture where live coding is performance art

---

## How it works

- **`sleep()` is a scheduler-controlled Promise.** Ruby's blocking `sleep` is impossible in JS without freezing the UI. Instead, `sleep` returns a Promise that only the VirtualTimeScheduler can resolve — giving cooperative concurrency with virtual time across multiple `live_loop`s.
- **Ruby DSL → JS via Tree-sitter.** Your Sonic Pi code is parsed into an AST and transpiled to JavaScript builder chains. No regex hacks — full structural awareness of blocks, symbols, and Ruby semantics.
- **Real SuperCollider synthesis.** Audio runs through SuperSonic (scsynth compiled to WebAssembly via AudioWorklet). Same synth definitions, same sound — not a simplified approximation.

```ruby
live_loop :drums do
  sample :bd_haus
  sleep 0.5
  sample :sn_dub
  sleep 0.5
end
```

Press Run. Now add this while the drums are playing:

```ruby
live_loop :bass do
  use_synth :tb303
  play :e2, release: 0.3, cutoff: rrand(60, 120)
  sleep 0.25
end
```

The bass joins in. Change a number. Hit Run again. The music updates instantly. That's live coding.

## What can I do with it?

**Write Sonic Pi code** -- the same Ruby DSL you know from desktop. `live_loop`, `play`, `sleep`, `sample`, `with_fx`, `use_synth`, `sync`, `cue` -- it all works.

**Perform live** -- 10 buffers, hot-swap on Re-run, Alt+R/Alt+S shortcuts, fullscreen mode, spectrum visualizer. Built for the stage.

**Teach** -- zero setup means students open a URL and start coding. Friendly error messages with line numbers. Built-in examples from simple beats to full compositions.

**Embed anywhere** -- drop the engine into any web page, LMS, or creative coding tool as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mjayb/sonicpijs).

## Getting Started

### Option 1: Just open the website

**[sonicpi.cc](https://sonicpi.cc)** -- nothing to install.

### Option 2: Run locally

```bash
npx sonicpijs
```

### Option 3: Embed in your app

```bash
npm install @mjayb/sonicpijs
```

```ts
import { SonicPiEngine } from '@mjayb/sonicpijs'

const engine = new SonicPiEngine()
await engine.init()
await engine.evaluate(`
  live_loop :beat do
    sample :bd_haus
    sleep 0.5
  end
`)
engine.play()
```

## Tech stack

TypeScript 6, Vite, Vitest (703 tests), CodeMirror 6, Web Audio API, WebAssembly.

## Compatibility with Desktop Sonic Pi

~95% of Sonic Pi syntax runs unmodified. 703 tests verify parity.

**Identical:** seeded PRNG (Mersenne Twister), synth definitions, sample library, music theory, timing semantics, hot-swap, sync/cue.

**Different:** browser audio latency is higher (~20ms vs ~5ms), OSC output requires a host-provided transport (hook-based), some niche Ruby syntax may not be covered.

See [KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md](KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md) for the full list.
